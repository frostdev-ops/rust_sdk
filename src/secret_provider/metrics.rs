#![cfg(feature = "metrics")]
//! Metrics for the Secret Provider.
//!
//! This module provides metrics collection for the Secret Provider, using the
//! metrics crate. It is designed to be used with any metrics implementation
//! that supports the metrics API.

use std::time::Instant;

/// Records a secret provider operation.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `provider` - The name of the provider (e.g., "env", "file", "memory")
/// * `operation` - The operation being performed (e.g., "get", "set", "keys")
/// * `outcome` - The outcome of the operation ("success" or "error")
pub fn record_operation(_provider: &str, _operation: &str, _outcome: &str) {
    // Stub implementation - will be reimplemented later
}

/// Records a secret rotation event.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `provider` - The name of the provider that performed the rotation
/// * `count` - The number of secrets rotated
pub fn record_rotation(_provider: &str, _count: usize) {

}

/// Records cache statistics for secret client.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `hit` - Whether the cache was hit (true) or missed (false)
pub fn record_cache_access(_hit: bool) {
    // Stub implementation - will be reimplemented later
}

/// A utility struct to measure and record operation durations.
